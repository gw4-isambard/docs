Support
=======

The first point of contact for all issues and queries is the Isambard Support helpdesk, which can be reached via email at isambard-support@gw4.ac.uk.

Support is available Monday to Friday from 9:00 until 17:00, excluding UK public holidays.

Please try and provide as much information as possible when raising an issue to allow us to help you more effectively.
Include your username and project code (if applicable).
You can attach log files to your email if necessary.

After submitting your query, you will receive an automatic acknowledgement that we have received your email, which will include a unique ID used for further correspondence.
A member of our support team will follow up via email to discuss your query until a resolution is achieved.

Closed queries are kept in our database, so that we can refer back to them when solving future problems, and when writing our documentation.
This database is protected by the :ref:`Personal Data and Privacy Policy <privacy>`.
