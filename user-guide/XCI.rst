Running
=======

Since the XCI system uses Cray ALPS to run jobs all executables run in jobs need to be run with ``aprun`` otherwise the jobs can run on the MOM nodes that can cause problems.

Queues
======

Work is submitted via the ``arm`` queue. 

There is also an ``arm-dev`` queue for running interactive development jobs up to three hours in duration. To specify an interactive job add the ``-I`` flag to your ``qsub`` command.

To target the larger memory nodes, add the following to your job script:

.. code-block::

  #PBS -l mem=500GB

Caveats
^^^^^^^

The default python version on login nodes is a system-bundled version, be sure to load a version of ``cray-python``. 

Known errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some Cray compilers will emit this error message:

.. code-block::

  No supported cpu target is set, CRAY_CPU_TARGET=aarch64 will be used.
  Load a valid targeting module or set CRAY_CPU_TARGET

To silence this message and to ensure the correct CPU optimisations are applied, run the following before using the compiler:

``module load craype-arm-thunderx2``
