gdb4hpc
=======

gdb4hpc is a parallel debugger for C, C++ and Fortran programs and is
available on both the MACS and XCI systems as part of the Cray Programming Environment.
It is a command line tool (based on gdb) and it can be used either to launch an application or attach to application which is already running.

Modules
---------

To use gdb4hpc you will need to load the gdb4hpc module by running the command
::

  module load gdb4hpc

When you have loaded the module you can see gdb4hpc documentation by running the command ``man gdb4hpc``. 

Example session
----------------

This example shows how to use gdb4hpc to attach to a program which is already running. In this example we have a C program parallelised with MPI but there is a bug causing a deadlock and we want to find out where in the program this is happening.

Start by building the program using a ``-g`` flag so that we can see line numbers in the debugger::

  cc -g -o deadlock deadlock.c

where the source code is in a file called ``deadlock.c`` and the executable is called ``deadlock``.  Now submit the program to queue as usual::

  qsub debug.pbs

where ``debug.pbs`` is the job script. The application will deadlock and sit in the queue so we can now attach the debugger. We need to find a ID number for the application which we will obtain with the ``apstat`` command as follows::

  xx-user@xcil00:~> apstat -u $USER
  Compute node summary
      arch config     up   resv    use  avail   down rebootq
        XT    163    160    155    142      5      3       0

  No pending applications are present

  Total (filtered) placed applications: 1
     Apid  ResId    User PEs Nodes   Age State Command        
  1324249 492947 xx-user   2     1 0h00m   run deadlock

  No applications or reservations are being cleaned up
  xx-user@xcil00:~> 

The application ID is 1324249 (shown underneath Apid) and we will use this ID number to attach to the application.  Next load the gdb4hpc module and start the debugger::

  module load gdb4hpc

To attach to the application we use the ``attach`` command followed by a handle (we will call this ``prog1``) and the applicaton ID (1324249) which we obtained from from ``apstat``::

  dbg all> attach $prog1 1324249

The debugger shows us that the rank 0 process is at a ``PMPI_Finalise`` call on line 24 and the rank 1 process is at a ``PMPI_Recv`` call on line 20. 

To exit the debugging session use the `quit` command ::

  dbg all> quit
  Shutting down debugger and resuming application for 'prog1'.
