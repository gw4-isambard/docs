Application for access
======================

Isambard in many cases can be an option to select when applying for research grants, especially with EPSRC.  To get
approval of the use of Isambard we recommend completing the "Access to HPC" documents at:

https://www.ukri.org/publications/access-to-high-performance-computing-application-documents/

Once complete, please send email and include the document to the Isambard support desk at isambard-support@gw4.ac.uk
