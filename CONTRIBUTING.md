## What you need to know

Isambard docs provides user documentation for the GW4 Tier-2 HPC, Isambard.
The project is funded by EPSRC and operated by the Universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter, hosted at the MetOffice and supported by HPE Cray, Arm and Marvell.
It is built using [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with pages written using the [reStructuredText format](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).
You will need to install `sphinx` to build the documentation locally (available from most package managers or via `pip install sphinx`.
Run `make html` to build the HTML documentation, which is generated into the `_build/html/` directory.
Content is written in Ipthon notebooks allowing the intermixing of `md` and code.
To facilitate the initial development we will not be making full use of nbfancy's capability will principally be using `md` and not the ability to render IO from code.
Wherever possible you should avoid use md rather than html to simplify contributions.
